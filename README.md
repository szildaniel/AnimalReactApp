### Project is made only for learning purpose.

That is a bit educational project, you can find out how a 5 diffrent Animals life cycle looks like.

I created 5 Components **Frog**, **Ladybug**, **Butterfly**, **Bee**, **Bat** and inside are a picture of life cycle and interesting description. Whole **data is stored and imported from animalData.js** file and forwarded by props and state to lower components. 

I added also some animations **CSSTransition** and **react-animations packages**. AnimalSlider is a functional component where i used **React Hooks**: useState for changing state and **useReducer** to dispatch actions.

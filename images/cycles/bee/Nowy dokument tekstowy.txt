eggs: The honey bee metamorphosis begins when the queen lays an egg. The eggs are mighty tiny only about 1.7 millimeters long. 
	The queen lays a single egg in each cell that has been cleaned and prepared by the workers to raise new brood. 
	The cell must be spotless, or she moves on to another one. Smaller cells are for female worker bees, and larger cells for male drone bees.

larva: Three days after the queen lays the egg, it hatches into a larva (the plural is larvae). 
	Healthy larvae are snowy white and resemble small grubs curled up in the cells. Tiny at first, 
	the larvae grow quickly, shedding their skin five times. These helpless little creatures have voracious appetites, consuming 1,300 meals a day.
	Within just five days, they are 1,570 times larger than their original size.

pupa: 	The larva is now officially a pupa (the plural is pupae). Here’s where things really begin to happen.The eyes, legs, and wings take shape. 
	Coloration begins with the eyes: first pink, then purple, then black. Finally, the fine hairs that cover the bee’s body develop.

adult: After 12 days, the now adult bee chews her way through the wax capping to join her sisters and brothers.

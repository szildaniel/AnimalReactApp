eggs: Probably you know what adult ladybugs look like, but you wouldn’t even recognize 
	them before they get to that final stage of their lives. Female ladybugs lay their eggs on the underside of leaves. 
	This is to protect them from being seen by flying predators as well as from the weather. A mother will lay
	from 10-15 eggs in one place, they look similar to yellow jellybeans, except that they are tiny.

larva: Once the eggs hatch, the larvae will come out and start looking for something to eat. 
	Newborn larvae look sort of like tiny alligators. After only a few days, the larvae will be large enough 
	to begin to molt (shed their skin), and they keep molting for as long as they are growing. 
	You can find the molted skins on leaves if you look very hard.

pupa: After a couple of weeks of growing, the larvae will start to change into something that looks like a shrimp. 
	It will find a leaf to attach itself to and it will seem to fall asleep for a few days, 
	but it is not sleeping at all. 
	During the pupa stage, the larvae are going through a metamorphosis into a ladybug.

adult: When the metamorphosis is complete, the skin of the larvae will split open and the full grown ladybug will emerge, 
	but it still won’t look like the ladybug that you know so well. 
	It will look soft and pink or very pale for a couple of hours until its shell becomes hard. 
	As the shell hardens it also gains pigment, which causes the ladybug to become bright red.

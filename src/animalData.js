            After about 4 weeks, the gills start getting grown over by skin, until they eventually disappear. 
            The tadpoles get teeny tiny teeth which help them grate food turning it into soupy oxygenated particles. 
            They have long coiled guts that help them digest as much nutrients from their meadger diets as possible.
            By the fourth week, tadpoles can actually be fairly social creatures. Some even interact and school like fish!`
